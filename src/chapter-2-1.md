Establishing clear and realistic workplace expectations is essential to fostering positive relationships and achieving success in the workplace.

This can help increase efficiency and effectiveness and minimize conflicts or misunderstandings.

It's important to note that workplace expectations can vary depending on the industry, company, and individual role. What may be considered a reasonable expectation in one setting may not be relevant or applicable in another. It's also important to regularly review and adjust workplace expectations as needed to ensure they remain relevant and achievable based on changing circumstances.

In summary, workplace expectations are the set of standards, goals, and responsibilities that define how colleagues, superiors, and subordinates interact and collaborate in a workplace setting. Establishing clear and realistic expectations is essential to fostering positive relationships, increasing productivity, and achieving success in the workplace.
