3. Revisit Expectations Regularly: Revisit expectations regularly to ensure that they remain relevant and achievable. This could involve adjusting performance metrics, revisiting goal-setting with team members, or exploring new opportunities for growth and development.

4. Provide Support and Resources: Provide support and resources to team members who are struggling to meet expectations. This could involve offering coaching, training, or other forms of professional development to help team members improve their skills or knowledge.

5. Recognize Progress and Achievements: Recognize progress and achievements made towards meeting expectations. Celebrate successes along the way and provide positive feedback and recognition to team members who are making progress towards meeting expectations.
